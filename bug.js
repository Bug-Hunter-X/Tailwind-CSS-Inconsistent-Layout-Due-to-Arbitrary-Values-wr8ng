```javascript
// Example using Tailwind's arbitrary value feature
<div class="w-72 bg-gray-200"></div>
```
This is valid Tailwind syntax, but it can lead to unexpected behavior if the arbitrary value (72 in this case) is not carefully considered in different contexts, leading to layout issues across various screen sizes or inconsistencies with other elements.
